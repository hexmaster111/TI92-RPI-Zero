Use a pin on the pi as a way to know if the system is on and if that pin goes low we disconnect the battery from the 5v converter



if power=off & PowerButton=on //Turn on +5v rail (ColdBoot)
	SETPIN goes high
	wait(50ms)
	SETPIN goes low
	wait(1min)

	

if PiOnPin=low & power=on  //Shutdown pi after power on pin goes low
	RESETPIN high
	Wait(50ms)
	RESETPIN low


if PiOnPin=high & power=on & PowerButton=on //Force Shutdown 
	if PowerButton = held for 10 sec
		RESETPIN high
		Wait(50ms)
		RESETPIN low
